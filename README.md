# Crunchyroll - WebOS TV App

Unofficial WebOS TV App for Crunchyroll.\
The last Crunchyroll app you will ever need!

## Usage - For Everyone

Just open the browser on your WebOS TV, then navigate to <https://mateussouzaweb.com/tv>.

Add to favorites and enjoy!

## Usage - For Developers

This method will install Crunchyroll as TV App, but is recommended only for developers:

- Install WebOS SDK (<http://webostv.developer.lge.com/sdk/installation/>)
- Enable TV for Testing (<http://webostv.developer.lge.com/develop/app-test/>)
- Clone this repository, then run the following code to install the App:

```bash
./scripts.sh deploy # OR
./scripts.sh test
```

Developer Mode is enabled only for 50 hours, so you will need to renew developer session every 50 hours to keep using Crunchyroll as app... :(

## Support

Support me for future versions for Samsung, Android TV, Chromecast and Others.
